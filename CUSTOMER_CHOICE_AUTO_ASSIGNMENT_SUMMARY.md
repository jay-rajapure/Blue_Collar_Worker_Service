# Customer Choice & Auto-Assignment Feature Implementation

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

‚úÖ **Auto-Assignment System**: System automatically assigns the best available worker to customer bookings
‚úÖ **Customer Choice**: Customers can view assigned worker profile and reject once
‚úÖ **Fair Distribution**: Ensures balanced job distribution among workers  
‚úÖ **Worker Profiles**: Enhanced worker profiles with ratings, experience, skills, and certifications
‚úÖ **Smart Reassignment**: If customer rejects, system assigns next best available worker
‚úÖ **Complete Workflow**: Seamless experience from booking to worker confirmation

## üèóÔ∏è **Backend Architecture**

### **1. Enhanced Models**

#### **Users Model (`Users.java`)**
- Added worker profile fields: `rating`, `totalRatings`, `experienceYears`, `bio`, `skills`, `certifications`
- Added availability tracking: `isAvailable`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- Added profile image support: `profileImage`

#### **New BookingStatus Values (`BookingStatus.java`)**
```java
PENDING,
WORKER_ASSIGNED,    // Worker has been auto-assigned by system
WORKER_REJECTED,    // Customer rejected the assigned worker
CONFIRMED,          // Worker accepted and customer approved
IN_PROGRESS,
COMPLETED,
CANCELLED,
REJECTED
```

#### **WorkerAssignment Entity (`WorkerAssignment.java`)**
- Tracks assignment attempts and rejections
- Records assignment order, status, and timestamps
- Links booking, worker, and assignment history

#### **AssignmentStatus Enum (`AssignmentStatus.java`)**
```java
ASSIGNED,               // Worker has been assigned
ACCEPTED,              // Worker accepted the assignment
REJECTED_BY_WORKER,    // Worker rejected the assignment  
REJECTED_BY_CUSTOMER,  // Customer rejected the assigned worker
EXPIRED               // Assignment expired without response
```

### **2. Services & Repositories**

#### **WorkerAssignmentService (`WorkerAssignmentService.java`)**
- **Auto-assignment logic**: Finds best worker based on rating, experience, location, skills
- **Rejection handling**: Manages customer and worker rejections
- **Smart matching**: Skills-based worker matching for specific job categories
- **Exclusion logic**: Prevents reassigning previously rejected workers

#### **Enhanced BookingService (`BookingService.java`)**
- **Auto-booking endpoint**: Creates bookings without requiring workerId
- **Assignment integration**: Automatically assigns best worker on booking creation
- **Rejection handling**: Supports customer rejection and reassignment
- **Status management**: Tracks booking through assignment workflow

#### **Enhanced UsersRepository (`UsersRepository.java`)**
- **Worker queries**: Find available workers by rating, location, experience
- **Exclusion queries**: Find workers excluding specific IDs for reassignment
- **Filtering options**: Support for complex worker matching criteria

### **3. Controllers & Endpoints**

#### **BookingController - New Endpoints**
```java
POST /api/bookings/auto                    // Create booking with auto-assignment
PUT  /api/bookings/{id}/reject-worker      // Customer rejects assigned worker
PUT  /api/bookings/{id}/accept-assignment  // Worker accepts assignment
PUT  /api/bookings/{id}/reject-assignment  // Worker rejects assignment
```

#### **WorkerProfileController (`WorkerProfileController.java`)**
```java
GET  /api/worker-profile/{workerId}    // Get worker profile (for customers)
GET  /api/worker-profile/my-profile    // Get own profile (for workers)
PUT  /api/worker-profile/update        // Update worker profile
```

## üé® **Frontend Implementation**

### **1. Enhanced Booking Flow**

#### **Modified booking.js**
- **Auto-assignment**: No longer requires worker selection - system picks best worker
- **Service-only booking**: Customers only select service, not specific worker
- **Updated API calls**: Uses `/api/bookings/auto` endpoint
- **Success messaging**: Shows that worker has been auto-assigned

#### **Updated services.js**
- **Simplified booking**: Removes workerId parameter from booking links
- **Service-focused**: Customers browse services rather than workers

### **2. Worker Assignment Interface**

#### **worker-assignment.html**
- **Professional design**: Clean, informative worker assignment page
- **Worker profile display**: Shows comprehensive worker information
- **Action buttons**: Accept or reject assigned worker
- **Status indicators**: Clear booking status and next steps

#### **worker-assignment.js**
- **Profile loading**: Fetches assigned worker profile details
- **Interactive actions**: Handles worker acceptance/rejection
- **Real-time updates**: Updates booking status and reassigns if needed
- **User feedback**: Success/error messaging and confirmations

### **3. Enhanced My Bookings**

#### **Updated my-bookings.js**
- **New status handling**: Supports WORKER_ASSIGNED and WORKER_REJECTED statuses
- **Worker assignment link**: "View Assigned Worker" button for WORKER_ASSIGNED bookings
- **Status-specific actions**: Different buttons based on booking workflow stage

## üîÑ **Complete Workflow**

### **Customer Journey**
1. **Browse Services** ‚Üí Customer sees available services (not specific workers)
2. **Select Service** ‚Üí Choose service based on price, description, ratings
3. **Book Service** ‚Üí Fill booking form (no worker selection needed)
4. **Auto-Assignment** ‚Üí System automatically assigns best available worker
5. **Review Worker** ‚Üí Customer receives notification with assigned worker profile
6. **Accept/Reject** ‚Üí Customer can accept or reject (once) assigned worker

4. **Service Delivery** ‚Üí If accepted, proceed with scheduled service

### **System Logic**
1. **Smart Matching** ‚Üí Algorithm considers rating, location, skills, availability
2. **Fair Distribution** ‚Üí Prevents same worker getting all assignments
3. **Exclusion Tracking** ‚Üí Remembers rejected workers to avoid repeat assignments
4. **Automatic Reassignment** ‚Üí Seamlessly assigns next best worker if rejected
